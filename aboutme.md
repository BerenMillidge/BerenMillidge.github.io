title: About me
---
Hi, I'm Beren.

Currently I'm a cofounder at a startup in the Bay Area. Prior to that I spent a brief time cofounding [Apollo Research](https://www.apolloresearch.ai), and before that I was Head of Research at [Conjecture](https://conjecture.dev).

Even further back, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in Computational Neuroscience at the University of Oxford working with Rafal Bogacz. I completed a PhD in Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh and was a visiting scholar at the University of Sussex working with Alexander Tschantz, Chistopher Buckley, and Anil Seth. This blog will be about AI and AI alignment,
neuroscience, the free-energy-principle, technology, mathematical models of social dynamics, strategy, and anything else I find interesting.

I currently live between the Bay Area and London with my wife Mycah.
