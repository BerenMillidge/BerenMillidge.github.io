Hi, I'm Beren.

I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh in Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience, and a visiting scholar at the University of Sussex working with Alexander Tschantz, Chistopher Buckley, and Anil Seth. This blog will be about AI,
neuroscience, the free-energy-principle, technology, mathematical models of social dynamics, strategy, and anything else I find interesting.
