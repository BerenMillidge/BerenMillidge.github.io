title: Self-Hosting beren.io
---

This website (now www.beren.io) is now self hosted! No longer will it rely exist solely at Github/Microsoft's discretion. It feels good.

I've been fiddling around with self-hosting for a day or so, largely to procrastinate out of actually writing content for the blog. It's been quite an adventure and surprisingly tricky thing to get working. I think I overcomplicated everything with a docker compose and multiple docker containers just to serve static files from nginx but oh well. I still dont' think ssl is working properly! Total cost is a Â£3/mo server from Hetzner -- so not bad! 

If you want the code I used to deploy it you can find it [here](https://github.com/BerenMillidge/blog_deployment) (ironically once again on Github).
