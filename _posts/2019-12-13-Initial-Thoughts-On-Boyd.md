title: "Initial Thoughts on Boyd and OODA Loops"
---

I've been reading Boyd's work again, this time focusing on the primary sources. I've not really begun to internalize it all yet, so expect more posts on this 
in the near future. This is just a set of initial, tentative thoughts about the OODA loop.

The first thing to note is that the OODA loop as finally envisaged by Boyd is significantly more nuanced than the general description. Compare the two below.

// add in

The basic OODA loop theory is that you want to cycle through the stages of the loop faster than the adversary. If you manage to orient and act faster than they can orient,
then they are effectively orienting to situations that have already changed, so their actions will be wrong, and then this failure will compound and your advantage will increase.
This approach emphasises relative speed as a key criterion in victory. The aim is to move faster, more unexpectably, and more nimbly than the enemy can expect,
and in this way crush their ability to respond.

This all seems reasonable and likely works well, depending on the domain. In many domains speed *is* a critical advantage. Another important thing is that it is only 
*relative* speed that matters. You only have to orient and act faster than the other guy can orient to gain a compounding advantage. Due to this, one of the key capabilities
of any successful system is that of "fast transients". I.e. the ability to command fast "accelerations" where acceleration is meant in some abstract sense.
This is effectively what is meant in organizational terms as being "nimble".  That is, the ability to make **rapid decisions** which can be **executed quickly** to 
achieve **rapid changes in behaviour** which are **unpredictable** is key to success in this model. Boyd has a good discussion with this in jet fighters. 
The key advantage of the jet fighter in a dogfight is not necessarily the top speed (at least this was presumably true in the 1970s), but rather the ability to
rapidly accelerate and decellerate with a short turning circle compared to the other guy. 

Is this true in the general sense? I would argue no. It only applies in certain strategic situations, which are primarily focused around strategic contests with small numbers of participants,
where actions are faster or of the same order of magnitude duration as orientation, where a good model of the strategic game is largely known to all participants,
where the downstream effects of actions are predictable to at least the first order, and where actions are rapidly reversible and don't have high costs, but also have immediate strong effects.

Let's look at these conditions in turn. It is worth noting that these conditions apply in many military situations, potentially up to the level of theatre strategy (i.e. in Blitzkriegs)
and extremely well in Boyd's initial domain - air-to-air dogfights. They also apply to some business situations, especially at lower levels, most sports and games, and 
diplomacy at some level. First though I want to go through why I think these conditions limit the applicability of the theory to certain situations.

1.) Actions are faster or of the same order of magnitude as orientation:
  * - this one is simple. The whole idea of the OODA loop is to orient *and act* faster than the other guy can orient. This is impossible if actions take a significantly longer time to achieve
  than an orientation step. For instance, consider competition between a bunch of heavy-industry competitors. Suppose one competitor decides to build a new factory. This can take years
  to get up and running, is highly visible and essentially impossible to disguise from competitors. The competitors are also able to run analyses on the new factory and orient their own strategy to it
  (over a time-course of weeks or months) compared to the years for the factory to come online. There is no possible rapid OODA loop strategy here. This is because in this scenario
  rapid transients are impossible. OODA loop theory is not especially useful here. (Interestingly, this would change if, for instance, the new factory had some rapid prototyping tools to iterate on new products
  over a timescale of weeks, for instance. This means that rapid transients are again possible and OODA loop theory can apply. Also important to note is the relative speed. Weeks for a new product is not 
  fast by some objective measure, but is fast compared to how rapidly competitors can orient, and OODA loop theory applies).
 
2.) Strategic game has a small number of participants.
  * - This is necessary because the OODA loop theory requires a single or a couple of distinguished adversaries. If there are a large number of players, for instance in financial markets,
  then each player is not really orienting on what you specifically are doing, but to what some aggregate of activity over all players are doing. This does not mean that rapid orientation and 
  action are not useful in this scenario, they very definitely are. Being able to act on new information faster than other market participants is a *huge* advantage, but it removes the compounding 
  effect of the OODA loop. Your adversaries orientation ability is not progressively destroyed by your faster cycling within the loop. The benefits are constant rather than cascading.
  
 3.) A good model of strategic game is known to all participants; downstream effects of actions are predictable. 
  *  - the OODA loop is only effective IF a solid dynamics model of the world is known beforehand, and so are the effects of actions. It is impossible to really formulate any kind of strategy
  without this kind of knowledge and understanding of your domain. Doing stupid things faster is not necessarily any better than doing them slowly. A fighter "pilot" who doesn't know how to fly and has
  no idea what the buttons in the cockpit do is not going to outperform one that does, even if the one with no idea can react 10x faster to the situation. The result will just be a lot of random flailing
  without much effect rather than building a consistent advantage. I suspect a LOT of "action" that occurs in the worlds of business and politics is of this latter type,
  due to a lack of good understanding of how the domain actually works.
  
  * - In case of lacking a good world model understanding of a domain. The most important thing to do is *try to obtain such a model* which is more important than any specific strategy. 
  Generally strategy and effective action can *only* procede when such a model of the domain is available. Anything before that happens is not really a strategy in a full sense.
  
  4.) Actions must have large effects. 
    *  - Rapid transients are required both to be rapid *and* to have small effect sizes. There is not much point in rapid action if your actions don't do much.
  This just results in strategic flailing. The idea of the OODA loop is NOT to flail around doing lots of things randomly. It is to have a well considered strategy, and execute it and adapt on it
  rapidly.
