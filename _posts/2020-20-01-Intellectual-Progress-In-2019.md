Lots of people such as slatestarcodex are posting the intellectual progress they have made in the past decade, and I thought doing a similar thing. However the truth is that in 2010 I was a 15 year old moron and unlike a lot of people here, I wasn't a child prodigy and had effectively 0 intellectual development at age 15. As such, a decades long progress review would be a funny exercise since it would include essentially all my intellectual development to the present. Instead I have decided to take this opportunity to start on a habit of yearly intellectual progress reviews. So here is the review for just 2019.

Overall, my estimation of this past year had been somewhat disappointing. I have certainly learnt a lot and developed a lot but on the other hand I haven't been developing at a faster rate than last year. Ny gains this year have primarily been a result of velocity, not acceleration. This is a major problem, especially as there are still low hanging fruit -- especially anki, which I still have failed to implement and which is dragging my potential down significantly. My primary goal this year is to implement these capacity raising innovations such as anki and thus increase acceleration in development.

The good thing this past year has been focus on a specific topic in my PHD. This has earned significant dividends and is the primary life skill I have developed. For the first time in my life I have actually focused on a project long enough to ship it, and that had paid off. I am still really bad at this and have way more open projects than completed ones. My aim at least in the remainder of my PHD must be to resist the temptation to start a new bunch of projects but rather finish off and ship the currently open projects. One of which is this blog, where I have a whole bunch of partially written posts and very few posted. So expect more on this front too.

Anyhow, I see my principal intellectual developments as follows:

I finally understand active inference and predictive processing at an expert's level of detail. I have contributed original work to this field, which while not groundbreaking I believe is valuable. Hopefully next year I will continue my contributions here.

I now understand reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning at a deep level. I can read papers at the forefront of the field and understand and critically evaluate them. I hope to contribute original work to this field in the coming year.

I have gotten into the julia programming language. I had nibbled around the edges in it up since 2017 but never fully got into it
In 2019 I made a significant amount if progress in it and while definitely not an expert, I did complete a major project with it and plan to use it deeply on other things as well.

I have made significant progress mathematically with understanding robotics and control theory. Before this year I didn't even have a really good idea of what it was but now I feel like I have a good basic understanding, and it does inform my work. This was a result of competing server courses in this field.

A second progress comes with my basic understanding I'd statistics. I had never done a college level statistics course before and though had some scattered understanding as a result of machine learning, lacked a firm foundation in the basics. I feel that I started to build that this year some basic foundations in this subject and I have made a fair bit of progress in it. I understand the basics more deeply than before.

Beyond this relatively little progress was made in computer science or other related subjects. My maths remains pretty shaky and suspicious. My key goals for next year are primarily to focus and complete my PhD which will likely mean reduced investment in extracurricular learning, to the long term detriment of my intellectual development, but hopefully long term gains in potential after having completed it. Other than that since I think I know enough in my subject to try to make original contributions, my goal is to develop my understanding of the mathematical foundations. This is key. Ideally would achieve basic maths proficiency I'm courses such as real analysis, complex analysis, topology, and abstract algebra to deepen my understanding of the fundamentals before deep diving into ever more abstruse regions.

In term of additional focuses to learn this year mathematically, I have information theory and then ultimately information geometry seem important. Nonlinear filtering theory and SDEs would be a good thing to start getting some traction on. Those are probably the initial goals beyond that who knows. I also want to start branching out a little more into other subjects, specifically I'd like to look more deeply into economics, to help me understand the world more, and biology because it's super interesting and biotechnology will be becoming massively important by the decades end.

With reading progress was very porlor and last year I read very few books, probably only about 10. I need to improve this dramatically this year. I did well with video lectures and most of my gains of understanding come from this. I think I do well with this format.

January:
university of edinburgh natural computing -- genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization. Not especially useful except knowing that this field exists. Lots of fairly useless details about algorithms that work terribly now compared to deep learning but still useful for broadening knowledge.

Human behavioral biology. Really good lectures... incredibly fascinating. Bit at all relevant to my studies but really cool. Need to pick up his book to relearn and review the material.

Dayna computational neuroscience. Really interesting. Lots of detail I didn't retain. Since I had no real excuse to use it a lot of it faded. Oh well.

Feb: Bartosz Milewski category theory. Rely interesting but a lot of it faded and i lost interest towards the end. I know a fair bit about functora and categories although i don't think it imparted the "categorical way of thinking' very deeply. I think this is one of the things where you have to already be in a specific intellectual place to truly get and I'm not there yet.

March: none.
April: deep reinforcement learning Sergey Levine. This was really great. I'd already gone through David Silvers course but this really also improved my understanding and brought me up to modern state of the art.

Control Bootcamp, Steve Brunton. This was a really great intro to key parts of control theory in linear time invariant systems. Super cool and interesting. Very different seeing the engineering side of things.

Graphical models and variational inference. A good course but I didn't finish it. An intro to continuous time and winer processes etc.

May: none.

June: statistics 100 Harvard.

July: all of statistics. Control theory

August: MIT signals and systems. Numerical computation

Sept: control theory.

October: underactuated robotics.

November: none

December: none.
